# CREDISE Multi-Search

CREDISE Multi-Search is a Chrome extension that helps language learners to search multiple websites fast for word research.

Basically, this extension will place button at the end of the address bar and when you click it, a dialogue pops up and asks you “Which word do you want to look up?” and also lets you to choose the language you want to search the word. Then within in 2 seconds, you have a Google Images link to the word, a Forvo.com recording to download the pronunciation, a bilingual dictionary entry and a monolingual dictionary (wordreference.com) entry. Magic! 

# Why this Extension

Typically, it’s a bit of a pain to set up the above mentioned behavior in Chrome using Macros, but in preparation for learning a new language using the methods mentioned in [Fluent-Forever](http://fluent-forever.com/), I’ve decided to write one that makes it a lot easier.
